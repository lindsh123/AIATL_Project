Based on the limited information available, there are several possible diagnoses for the patient's symptoms of memory lapses and speech disturbances:

1. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):**  A TIA is a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain, causing neurological symptoms that typically resolve within 24 hours. It's a known risk factor for stroke, and the patient's family history of stroke makes this a plausible diagnosis. However, the lack of information regarding the duration, frequency, and severity of the symptoms makes a conclusive diagnosis difficult. 

2. **Anxiety-Related Cognitive Issues:** The patient has a history of anxiety disorder, and anxiety can manifest as cognitive difficulties, including memory lapses and speech disturbances. The patient's history of migraine headaches, which can also be exacerbated by anxiety, adds further weight to this possibility.

3. **Sleep Apnea-Related Cognitive Impairment:** Sleep apnea can disrupt sleep quality, leading to daytime fatigue and cognitive impairments, including memory lapses and difficulty concentrating. The patient's history of sleep apnea, even though controlled with CPAP, could contribute to their current symptoms.

4. **Medication Side Effects:**  Certain medications, particularly those used for hypertension and anxiety, can cause cognitive side effects such as memory problems and speech difficulties. It's crucial to consider the patient's current medications and their potential impact on their cognitive function. 

5. **Underlying Neurological Condition:**  While less likely given the lack of specific information, it's important to consider other neurological conditions like epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, or dementia, which can manifest with memory lapses and speech disturbances. However, these diagnoses require further investigation and clinical evaluation.

**It's crucial to conduct a thorough medical history review and physical examination, including neurological assessment, to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and rule out any serious medical conditions. Further investigations like brain imaging studies may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.**
