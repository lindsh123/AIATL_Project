Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, here are the possible diagnoses:

1. **Medication Side Effects:** Both amlodipine and propranolol, medications the patient is taking for hypertension and anxiety respectively, can cause cognitive side effects such as memory problems and speech difficulties. This is a strong possibility given the patient's symptoms and medication history.

2. **Anxiety-Related Cognitive Issues:** The patient has a history of anxiety disorder, and anxiety can manifest as cognitive difficulties, including memory lapses and speech disturbances. This is further supported by the patient's history of migraine headaches, which can also be exacerbated by anxiety.

3. **Sleep Apnea-Related Cognitive Impairment:** Sleep apnea can disrupt sleep quality, leading to daytime fatigue and cognitive impairments, including memory lapses and difficulty concentrating. The patient's history of sleep apnea, even though controlled with CPAP, could contribute to their current symptoms.

4. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):**  A TIA is a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain, causing neurological symptoms that typically resolve within 24 hours. It's a known risk factor for stroke, and the patient's family history of stroke makes this a plausible diagnosis. However, the lack of information regarding the duration, frequency, and severity of the symptoms makes a conclusive diagnosis difficult.

**It's crucial to conduct a thorough medical history review and physical examination, including neurological assessment, to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and rule out any serious medical conditions. Further investigations like brain imaging studies may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.**
