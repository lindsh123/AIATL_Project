Based on the medical history and current symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is a severe migraine headache. The patient has a history of migraine headaches, and the severity of the current headache is consistent with a severe migraine attack.  However, I would like to rule out other possibilities such as medication overuse headache, especially given the frequency of their headaches. I would need to ask the patient about their medication use, particularly over-the-counter pain relievers.  I would also like to know if the patient has any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or visual disturbances, as these can be helpful in differentiating between migraine and other types of headaches.
