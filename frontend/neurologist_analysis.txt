Based on the patient's reported symptoms and medical history, here are possible diagnoses:

1. **Anxiety-Related Cognitive Issues:** The patient has a history of anxiety disorder and reports experiencing episodes of feeling lightheaded and dizzy with trouble thinking clearly. Anxiety can manifest as cognitive difficulties, including memory lapses and speech disturbances. This is further supported by the patient's history of migraine headaches, which can also be exacerbated by anxiety. The gradual onset of symptoms over 4 months and their association with feelings of lightheadedness and dizziness make this a strong possibility.

2. **Sleep Apnea-Related Cognitive Impairment:**  The patient has a history of sleep apnea, even though controlled with CPAP. Sleep apnea can disrupt sleep quality, leading to daytime fatigue and cognitive impairments, including memory lapses and difficulty concentrating. While the patient's AHI was 22 events/hour at diagnosis, we need to confirm their current sleep quality and CPAP compliance. If their sleep quality is compromised, this could contribute to their current symptoms.

3. **Medication Side Effects:**  The patient is taking amlodipine and propranolol, medications for hypertension and anxiety, respectively. Both medications can cause cognitive side effects such as memory problems and speech difficulties. It's important to assess whether the patient's symptoms started after initiating these medications.

4. **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):**  A TIA is a temporary interruption of blood flow to the brain, causing neurological symptoms that typically resolve within 24 hours. The patient's family history of stroke makes this a plausible diagnosis. However, the lack of information regarding the severity and duration of the symptoms makes a conclusive diagnosis difficult. Additionally, the gradual onset of symptoms over 4 months makes TIA less likely. 

**It's important to conduct a thorough medical history review and physical examination, including neurological assessment, to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and rule out any serious medical conditions. Further investigations like brain imaging studies may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.**
