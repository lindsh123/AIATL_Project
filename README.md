# medmap.ai

medmap.ai is a transformative platform designed to assist chronically ill patients in managing their health by providing context-aware, predictive diagnoses through a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system. It allows patients to communicate their symptoms and receive tailored responses from virtual specialists, streamlining communication between patients and doctors. An alert to the most relevant doctors follow this diagnosis. 

## üöÄ Project Demo
**medmap.ai** empowers patients to communicate more effectively with doctors by providing a virtual assistant that can offer diagnostic suggestions based on symptoms, medical history, and specialist knowledge.

1. **User Profile Setup**: Patients and doctors can create their profiles, enabling a personalized experience to store medical history and contact information.
2. **Symptom Input**: Patients can describe their symptoms via text input. The platform then processes the description and uses a multi-agent system to analyze the symptoms.
3. **Multi-Agent Diagnosis**: The system features several agents, each with a specialized knowledge domain, including cardiology, pulmonology, and neurology, among others. These agents work together to:
    - **Decide the Specialist**: The agents collaborate to determine which specialist is best suited to address the patient's condition based on the input symptoms.
    - **Predictive Diagnosis**: The relevant agent uses the patient‚Äôs symptoms and medical history to provide a predictive diagnosis.
    - **Doctor Alerts**: Once the diagnosis is generated, the system automatically alerts doctors who specialize in the identified condition and have an account on the platform, ensuring they are aware of the patient's needs and can follow up for further evaluation.
4. **Diagnosis Delivery**: The system delivers the most relevant diagnosis, taking into account the patient's medical history, cultural considerations, and other contextual factors, followed by an alert to the appropriate doctor.

## üåü Key Features
- **Multi-Agent LLM**: Utilizes agents from [Google Gemini](https://www.google.com/search/about/) and [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) to enhance diagnostic capabilities.
- **Context-Aware Interactions**: Powered by LangChain for building context around patient data, ensuring highly relevant and personalized diagnostic responses.
- **Medical History Integration**: The platform maintains a medical history profile that ensures diagnoses are always tailored to the individual‚Äôs health background.
- **Doctor Alerts**: Alerts are automatically sent to the appropriate medical professionals based on the diagnosis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building a user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Python for handling data processing and running machine learning models.
- **Database & Hosting**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for real-time database management, user authentication, and hosting.
- **LLM & Agents**: [Google Gemini](https://www.google.com/search/about/) for multi-agent system integration and context-based responses.
- **Contextual Language Models**: [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) for chaining various language models and building contextual workflows.

## üí° How It Works
1. **User Profile Setup**: Patients create and personalize their profile, which is linked with their medical history to ensure tailored communication.
2. **Symptom Input**: The patient enters their symptoms, which are processed by the system.
3. **Diagnosis Generation**: Specialized agents analyze the symptoms and generate a diagnosis, considering contextual information such as medical history.
4. **Doctor Alerts**: Once a diagnosis is made, an alert is sent to the relevant medical professionals for further evaluation and consultation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/AIATL_Project.git
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Set up Firebase and API keys**: Configure your `.env` file with your Firebase credentials and API keys for Gemini and LangChain.
4. **Run the app**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
## üõ°Ô∏è Ethical Considerations
While developing **medmap.ai**, we focused on creating an inclusive platform for individuals with chronic illnesses. However, we acknowledge the importance of ethical considerations such as:
- **Accuracy**: There may be limitations in symptom interpretation and diagnosis accuracy.
- **Privacy & Security**: Patient data is stored securely through Firebase, ensuring confidentiality and compliance with data protection regulations.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: We consider cultural factors when generating responses to ensure that the system is inclusive and sensitive to different patient needs.
